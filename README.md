# Coursera-Capstone-Dashboard
This Repository contains all the code and notebooks developed to complete the Capstone project of Coursera Data Science Certification.
The aim of this project is to predict the success probability of Space X Booster recoveries based on historic lauch data,  including several launch features such as payload, booster version and so on.
A classification model was developed to predict the success/failure of future launches and thus translating this information on to bidding process of competitors.
